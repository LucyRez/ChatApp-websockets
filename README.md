# ChatApp-websockets
This is a demo version of the chat app.

### In this project I'm using:
- NodeJS for the server + Socket.io library
- Swift (client on SwiftUI)

### What was done:
- Simple server on NodeJS
- Connection between client and server via web sockets
- Basic functionality for delivering and receiving messages
- Message history is saved on the server (with MongoDB)
- Client gets all the message history on connection
- User Interface using SwiftUI
